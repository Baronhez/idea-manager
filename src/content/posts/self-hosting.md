I know, you want to self host, for instance, your own webpage, but every time you search for info, people only recommend you to use sh\*t like NO-IP and third party providers such as Heroku. But that's not what you want, right? You have a Rashberry Pi or some old PC and you intent to host your own services, like your webpage, a torrent server or even some filebrowser to manage storage.

Ok, then I will save you a lot of hours or researching how to mount everything, how to deal with nginx, how to get https certificates... and I will show you the best way of setting up everything.

## Prepare your server machine

Firtsly, I will start by getting an ISO of Ubuntu Server (you can use another ISOs, like arch linux or Nix, if you are brave enough).Â 

[https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso)

Then, use some program, like [Rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.17/rufus-3.17.exe) or [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash that ISO into an USB or SD Card (in case you're using a Rashberry Pi).

If you are not familiar with this, take a look into [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt0Q-DBejIw).

Ok, now we have an USB or SD Card flashed with our favourite OS for our server. Now it is time to insert that into the server we will be using. If it's possible I recommend you to connect that device to a monitor, in order to see what is happening and make some SSH configurations.

Once the operating system is installed, we will create a new user and get rid of the default user. (Using the root user for everything is a bad idea).

```
sudo adduser Username
sudo usermod -aG sudo Username
```

## How to connect to our machine

Next, we will configure SSH to be able to connect to our device from another pc. This way it is easier to manage the server (and we will be able to disconnect the monitor from the server).

I have another guide about how configure SSH to be secure and ready to use, go ahead a [check it](https://blog.jonthan.xyz/how-to-configure-ssh-to-be-secure/).

## Unattended upgrades (optional)

If you don't want automated updates, skip this section.

Ok, now that we are able to connect to the server using SSH, and SSH is configure to be secure, it is time to install our first packages.

```
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades
# Now, select yes to enable unattended-upgrades.
# Once you finish with that, you can change some lines in the configuration of unattended-upgrades.
nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic
```

For instance, you can configure something like this:

```
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1";
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
```

## Email your logs to yourself (optional)

If you don't want to email your logs, skip this section.

If you want to keep track of your logs and email them to you, then you can use [Logwatch](https://linux.die.net/man/8/logwatch).

To install and configure logwatch, run these commands:

```
sudo apt-get install logwatch
nano /etc/cron.daily/00logwatch
```

Then, add this line:

```
/usr/sbin/logwatch --output mail --mailto yourmail@gmail.com --detail high  
```

## Installation of Docker and Docker-Compose

The rest of the guide focuses on using docker and docker-compose to deploy services. If you want to deploy your services manually by configuring nginx and cert-manager, go ahead and try it yourself. If you want to do it using kubernetes, I will publish a guide as soon as possible.

It's time to install docker and docker compose.

You can do it manually:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common  
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"  
apt-cache policy docker-ce
sudo apt install docker-ce
sudo systemctl status docker
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose  
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Or you can run this command, which runs a script to install Docker automatically:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

The content of the executed bash script is (at 10/02/2023) as follows:

```
#!/bin/sh
set -e
# Docker CE for Linux installation script
#
# See https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ for the installation steps.
#
# This script is meant for quick & easy install via:
#   $ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
#   $ sh get-docker.sh
#
# For test builds (ie. release candidates):
#   $ curl -fsSL https://test.docker.com -o test-docker.sh
#   $ sh test-docker.sh
#
# NOTE: Make sure to verify the contents of the script
#       you downloaded matches the contents of install.sh
#       located at https://github.com/docker/docker-install
#       before executing.
#
# Git commit from https://github.com/docker/docker-install when
# the script was uploaded (Should only be modified by upload job):

Now,Â assuming that everything went well, we should have docker and docker-compose installed in our server.Â  It's time to test docker-compose by deploying a small web in our local network.

```
mkdir app

Insert this content into the **index.html** file:

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Docker Compose Demo</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kognise/water.css@latest/dist/dark.min.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Docker Compose Demo Page.</h1>
<p>This content is being served by an Nginx container.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

Save the file, and run the following command:

```
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Insert this content into the **docker-compose.yml** file:

```
version: '3.7'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      - ./app:/usr/share/nginx/html
```

Now, to start our aplicationÂ containerized, we must run the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

That command should return an output like this one:

```
Creating network "compose-demo_default" with the default driver
Pulling web (nginx:alpine)...
alpine: Pulling from library/nginx
cbdbe7a5bc2a: Pull complete
10c113fb0c77: Pull complete

Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:alpine
Creating compose-demo_web_1 ... done
```

Now, your webpage should be accesible through your browser by typing "local-IP-of-your-server:8000".

Ok, now that we have a webpage deployed in our local network, I should share a few useful commands to manage Docker:

```
# We can see the logs of our containers
docker-compose logs
# Pause our containers
docker-compose pause
# Unpause our containers
docker-compose unpause
# Stop our containers
docker-compose stop
# Delete all the resources and volumes assigned to our containers
docker-compose down
# List our images
docker images
# Delete our images
docker image rm nginx:alpine
# Or
docker rmi nginx:alpine
# We can delete all stoped container, every network not use by al least one container, every unused image and all build cache.
docker system prune -a
# Do the same but filtering specific images
docker system prune --filter nginx:alpine
# Or just the volumes
docker system prune --volumes
# Or we can do the same but without asking for confirmation
docker system prune -a -f  
```

Now, if you want to deploy you web to the world outside your local network, you must change a few things in your router (supposing you have access to the router). It is completely necessary to set port-forwarding, because if you are mounting your server at home, your devices are connected inside your home using a private network. It is possible for us to connect to the internet thanks to [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation).Â 

Each router is a different world, so you must search information about how to port-forward in your home router.Â 

On the other hand, if you're using some provider for your server, such as a VM in Oracle Cloud, then it should be easier. Search for your specific provider how to port-forward and that's the end of the problem.

## Using a domain name and DDNS

Ok, if you want to access your webpage easily without having to memorize a bunch of numbers, you have to buy a domain name. I recommendÂ [https://www.namecheap.com/](https://www.namecheap.com/). It provides cheap domain names and it is also a DNS provider, but you can pick whichever you want.

If you want to point your domain name to your server, there is one problem if your server is in your home. Most ISPs (or all of them, to be honest) nowadays change your public IP from time to time. If you don't want to lose access to your webpage when that happens, we must use Dynamic DNS. It is necessary to set DDNS with your DNS provider and use a DDNS client in our server to comunicate with our DNS provider. The DDNS client will inform the DNS provider of your new IP.

I use [ddclient](https://ddclient.net/) for that, because Namecheap has a [guide](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/583/11/how-do-i-configure-ddclient/) to use it with them.

## Using HTTPS certificates from Let's Encrypt

Next step is to create HTTPS certificates for our webpage. The docker way of doing this is by configurating let's encrypt. We can do it using different methods, but the best for me is using one of the bestÂ Edge Router nowadays. I'm talking of [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/).

I will save you tons of documentation, because this guide is already too long. If you want to set a reverse proxy with traefik which also can generate certificates with Let's Encrypt, just use this files:

First, create an acme.json file and change its privilegies (take into account the path of the acme.json file, because you have to add that path to the **docker-compose.yaml** file:

```
touch acme.json
chmod 600 acme.json
```

Now, create a folder and two different files for traefik configuration (put your domain name where it says YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME and your preferred email where it says youremail@example.com):

```
mkdir ./config
nano ./config/traefik.yml
```

```
# traefik.yml
api:
  dashboard: true # Enable the dashboard
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
    http:
      redirections:
        entryPoint:
          to: web-secure
  web-secure:
    address: ":443"
    http:
      tls:
        certResolver: default
providers:
        # In order to get this working on docker, refer to https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/docker/ for more info.
  docker:
    endpoint: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
    exposedByDefault: false # As seen in the documentation, "Expose containers by default through Traefik. If set to false, containers that do not have a traefik.enable=true label are ignored from the resulting routing configuration".
  file:
    filename: /etc/traefik/config.yml # In order to get all my configuration info in a separate file (dinamic.yaml), I use https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/file/.
    watch: true # Watch for changes
    
certificatesResolvers: # Refer to https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#certificate-resolvers to more info. 
  default:
    acme:
      email: youremail@example.com 
      storage: /etc/traefik/acme/acme.json # Previously you have to create the file, change the permissions using chmod and then use a docker volume.
      keyType: 'EC384' # 
      tlsChallenge: true # https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#tlschallenge
```

Now, we have to configure one last yaml fileÂ (put your domain name where it says YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME):

```
nano ./config/config.yml
```

```
# config.yml
http:
  routers:
    traefik:
      rule: Host(`subdomainForTheDashboard.YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME`)
      entryPoints: 
        - "web-secure"
      service: api@internal
      middlewares:
        - secHeader
      tls:
        certResolver: default
  middlewares:
          # In order to modify the request, I use middlewares. In this case to force https.
    secHeader:
        # HSTS / Secure Headers, Useful to have a more secure experience with HTTPS
      headers:
        frameDeny: true
        sslRedirect: true
        browserXssFilter: true
        contentTypeNosniff: true
        stsIncludeSubdomains: true
        stsPreload: true
        stsSeconds: 31536000
tls:
        # Now, I refer to https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/tls/ for information. 
        # Options allow me to to configure some parameters of the TLS connection.
  options:
    default:
            # Now, here a use the min Version tls version 1.2 just as shown in the traefik documentation (This config will get an A+ grade in https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) 
      minVersion: VersionTLS12 # Refering to the Traefik Documentation, I use sniStrict because "Traefik won't allow connections from clients that do not specify a server_name extension or don't match any certificate configured on the tlsOption".
      sniStrict: true
      cipherSuites:
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
        - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
        - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384   # TLS 1.2
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305    # TLS 1.2
        - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384                  # TLS 1.3
        - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256            # TLS 1.3
        # Now I define the eliptic curves preferences for ECC cryptography
        # Refer to https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls#CurveID for more info
      curvePreferences:
        - CurveP521
        - CurveP384
    mintls13:
      minVersion: VersionTLS13
      sniStrict: true
```

Ok, this configuration should work flawlessly. You can add more middlewares, such as rate limit or plugins like fail2ban. I'm not covering that here right now.

Lastly, a **docker-compose.yaml**(put your domain name where it says YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME and put the path to your acme.json file and your webpage folder):

```
nano docker-compose.yaml
```

```
version: '3.7'
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:2.5.5
    container_name: traefik
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config/:/etc/traefik/
      - /path/to/acme.json:/etc/traefik/acme/acme.json
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  web:
    image: nginx:1.21.4-alpine
    container_name: web
    restart: always
    expose:
      - "80"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/webpage/folder:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.webpage.entryPoints=web-secure
      - traefik.http.routers.webpage.rule=Host(`YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME`)
      - "traefik.http.routers.webpage.middlewares=secHeader@file"
```

If you want to deploy more services, just add this to every new service in a docker-compose file:

```
 labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.NAME-ROUTER.entryPoints=web-secure
      - traefik.http.routers.NAME-ROUTER.rule=Host(`YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME`)
      - "traefik.http.routers.NAME-ROUTER.middlewares=secHeader@file"
```

Just remember to change NAME-ROUTER to another name each time (it is the name of the [traefik router](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/routers/)) and YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME should be a subdomain, such as **nextcloud.example.com**Â for a hipothetical nextcloud service.

To deploy this configuration, go to the folder where the **docker-compose.yaml** file is, and run the following command:

```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

If you go to your domain, assuming that you previouly pointed the domain to your server IP (or the public IP of your router, in case of a home server), the webpage should be displayed in the browser as intended.

If you want to get an A+ result in the SSL test fromÂ [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)Â then you have to add a CAA record.

You can find documentation about CAA records here:Â [https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9991/38/caa-record-and-why-it-is-needed-ssl-related/](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9991/38/caa-record-and-why-it-is-needed-ssl-related/)

And you can find a tool to create CAA records here: [https://sslmate.com/caa/](https://sslmate.com/caa/)

That's it, you have started in the selfhosting hobby. I recommend you this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/).

Good luck, lads.

This guide is a quick review of the Reddit Post that describes the entire process. Check it out

Please, if you already had installed Youtube Vanced, uninstall it and uninstall Micro G too, just to install the newest version of it.

Firstly, we have to donwload and install the Micro G APK to log into our Youtube Account. You can find the APK here: [https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/team-vanced/microg-youtube-vanced/microg-youtube-vanced-0-2-24-220220-release/vanced-microg-0-2-24-220220-android-apk-download/](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/team-vanced/microg-youtube-vanced/microg-youtube-vanced-0-2-24-220220-release/vanced-microg-0-2-24-220220-android-apk-download/)

Click on the DOWNLOAD APK button

Now, we have to download and install the Revanced Manager APK, to patch the youtube app APK with the features we want to add. You can find the latest APK here: [https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases/](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases/tag/v1.8.0)

![Revanced Manager APK](https://blog.jonthan.xyz/media/posts/26/1.PNG)

Download the selected file. In this case, it's the v1.8.0 version. Pick the latest one, the one at the top of the page!

Now you have to download (JUST DOWNLOAD, NOT INSTALL) the latest recommended Youtube APK for patching. This step is crucial because, from time to time, youtube Revanced stops working for your Youtube Version, so you have to download the latest recommended Youtube APK version again to patch it. Your can find the latest recommended Youtube APK in this post of Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/comments/xlcny9/revanced\_manager\_guide\_for\_dummies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/comments/xlcny9/revanced_manager_guide_for_dummies/)

You can find the download link here.

DO NOT INSTALL THE YOUTUBE APK. Just download the APK. First, we have to patch the Youtube APK using the Revanced Manager.

After entering that page, you have to click on this button to download the APK

Ok, now we have all the necessary pieces all together in our mobile phone, it is time to use the Revanced Manager to build our Youtube APK without ads!

Once it's done, tap install

You may get a warning saying the app install has been blocked by Play Protect.  
This is normal because the app is not from the Play Store.  
You can safely ignore the prompt and tap "More details" and then "Install anyway" to complete the install.

If this didn't work and the bottom right now says "Open", tap the 3 dots at the top right of your screen, then select "Export APK".  
Save it somewhere like your downloads folder.  
Then open your file browser app of choice, find the exported file and install it.  
It should be called something like _"youtube-revanced-versionnumber.apk"_.  
Now open YouTube ReVanced and log into your YouTube account.  

**Manager updates  
**  
The Revanced Manager will have a blue "update manager" button when an update is available.

Tapping this will download the update and prompt you to install it.

Congratulations, you have installed Youtube Revanced without any problem. Now, it's time to enjoy your personalized youtube without ads and with a more personal approach.
